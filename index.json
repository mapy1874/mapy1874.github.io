Well, lazy evaluation is a great modification to a basic evaluator. It follows the principle of laziness: delaying evaluation of procedure arguments until the last possible moment. Consider the following example from SICP\n(define (try a b) (if (= a 0) 1 b))  Using basic the evaluator in COMP524, (try 0 (/ 1 0)) will raise an error as the denominator cannot be 0. However, with lazy evaluation, there would be no error at all! Evaluating the example would return 1, as the argument (/ 1 0) would never be evaluated: the evaluator promises (/ 1 0) to be evaluated until it is actually used. We call languages with lazy evaluation as normal-order languages. Also, we say a procedure is non-strict in an argument if the argument is not evaluated before the body of the procedure.\nAnother example of lazy evaluation is short-circuit evaluation\nfalse \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (true || false \u0026amp;\u0026amp; true)  As we have the logical operator and here, any part being evaluated to false will lead to the whole expression being false. Thus, lazy evaluation will only look at false and skip (true || false \u0026amp;\u0026amp; true).\nFrom the above example, we can say that sometimes lazy evaluation can help reduce error, and we could save (perhaps loooong) evaluation time of an operand never needed in the body of a procedure. Popular languages like Python also integrate lots of lazy evaluation functionalities. We will see more pros and cons of lazy evaluation at the end of this post.\nTwo Implementations of Lazy Evaluation There are two implementations of lazy evaluation: call-by-name and call-by-need. Before we dive deeper into that, let\u0026rsquo;s introduce a new concept called thunk. The idea is that, argument evaluation is going to be delayed when applying a procedure. The delayed arguments will be transformed into objects called thunks, which contain necessary information to produce the value of the argument. That being said, a thunk must contain the argument expression and the environment when the procedure is being called. In other words, a thunk is a shell for a delayed expression. The following list can represent a thunk\n(list 'thunk exp env)  Thunk is an important object in implementing lazy evaluation. The process of forming a thunk is called freezing, or delay. The process of evaluating a thunk is called thawing, or forcing. When we want to evaluate thunks, we can memoize the value of the argument, or evaluate the same thunk again in the future. This leads two different implementations of lazy evaluation, defined here as follows:\n call-by-name: invokes thunk every time parameter is referenced; disadvantage: it is a waste of time when side-effects are not possible because the same value is returned each time call-by-need: records the value of each thunk the first time it is called, and thereafter refers to the saved value rather than re-invoking the thunk; this is an example of a more general technique called memoization, which is also used in dynamic programming (take COMP 550)  In other words, call-by-name is non-memoized lazy evaluation, while call-by-need is memoized lazy evaluation.\nUseful scenarios Stream Object With call-by-need, we could implement a stream abstraction. A stream object is a pair-like object, except the cdr part is not evaluated until needed. Thus, the data structure may be infinite!\n A stream object (from here)  Suppose we want to find the first 100 prime numbers between 1 to 100000000, without stream object, the procedure will look like\n(list-ref (filter (lambda (x) (prime? x)) (enumerate-interval 1 100000000)) 100)  This can be costly as we need to generate the entire list of integers from 1 to 100000000 before proceeding. Stream object can save us from generating a huge list. First, we define two helper procedures in generating stream objects as a list and selecting elements we want in the stream.\n;; generate a stream list, which is lazy (define (stream-interval a b) (if (\u0026gt; a b) the-empty-stream (cons-stream a (stream-interval (+ a 1) b)))) ;; filter out elements satify the predicate in stream (define (stream-filter predicate str) (if (predicate (stream-car str))\t;; 1st elt of stream satisfies predicate. e.g., elt is a prime num (cons-stream (stream-car str) (stream-filter predicate (stream-cdr str))) (stream-filter predicate (stream-cdr str)))) ;; stream-car, stream-cdr, cons-stream are procedures ;; implementing lazy evaluation for the stream object  Then we have the improved version of list-ref\n(stream-ref (stream-filter (lambda (x) (prime? x)) (stream-interval 1 100000000)) 100)  stream-interval promises to generate the numbers between 1 to 10000000, but once the first value is generated, it is immediately passed to stream-filter. Then stream-filter will ask for the next element in the stream. The program will now go back to stream-interval for the second number, etc. As a consequence, we just need to find the first 100 prime numbers and exit the procedure using stream-ref now!\nyield in Python Here is another similar example in Python.\nWe are used to writing code like createIterable. This can be troublesome when the list size is so large that the performance of programs may be compromised. The keyword yield can solve this by following the principle of laziness. createGenerator will not return an actual element until it is forced to \u0026ldquo;yield\u0026rdquo; one. In other words, when you call the function, the code you have written in the function body does not run. Thus, createGenerator processes i=0, and takes a break until the next element in the generator is asked. Because of its laziness, what yield returns can only be used once, while an iterable list can be iterated multiple times.\n# return a list as a whole def createIterable(): mylist = [] for i in range(3): mylist.append(i*i) return mylist for i in createIterable(): print(i)\t# print 0, 1, 4 # yield elements one by one def createGenerator(): mylist = range(3) for i in mylist: yield i*i for i in createGenerator(): print(i)\t# print 0, 1, 4  More about Lazy Evaluation Pros (based on Dr. Perugini\u0026rsquo;s PL course)\n saves the work required to evaluate an unused argument and sometimes prevent an error leads to a uniform language; no need for special syntactic forms (e.g., if) language can be extended by programmers in standard ways  Cons (based on Dr. Perugini\u0026rsquo;s PL course)\n call-by-name can be inefficient if an argument is used more than once in the body (so use call-by-need version then) call-by-need makes a program difficult to understand in the presence of side-effects  Other applications of lazy evaluation (based on Dr. Perugini\u0026rsquo;s PL course)\n same-fringe problem combinatorial search (e.g., a tree) in AI lends itself to straightforward implementation of important recursive algorithms (e.g. quicksort) overall, streams and filters are used in concert in a genertor-filter style of programming  Other Laziness in Computer Science\n Caching: keeping copies of data around DevOps: automating the deployment and maintenance cycle Documentation: writing great documentation about your code so that others won’t bother you  ","date":1614097241,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582474841,"objectID":"ea36a15f773d2113ed2cd6dfba4b9841","permalink":"https://mapy1874.github.io/post/lazy-evaluation/","publishdate":"2021-02-23T13:20:41-03:00","relpermalink":"/post/lazy-evaluation/","section":"post","summary":"What\u0026amp;Why When you see the name lazy evaluation, you might wonder what is its difference from evaluation, which means running the program according to the semantics of your language.

Using a volume, you map a directory inside the container to a persistent storage.\ndocker run -v /your/dir:/var/lib/mysql -d mysql:5.7  List the local images:\ndocker image ls  2. Create Docker Image Two basic components: A Docker image is created using the docker build command and a Dockerfile file.\nDockerfile Instructions FROM: A Dockerfile file always begins with a FROM instruction because every image is based on another base image.\nFROM node:11-alpine   Don’t use latest! First of all, it doesn’t mean that any running container will be based on the latest available version of the nginx image. Docker is about having reproducible images, so the latest version is evaluated when you build your image, not when the container is run. This means that the version will not change unless you run the docker build command again.\n COPY: Useful when I want files to be part of an image I create. Its first parameter is the file to be copied from the build context and its second parameter is the destination directory inside the image.\nCOPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html  CMD: The CMD instruction specifies which executable is run when a container is created using your image and provides optional arguments.\nBoth the program to run and its arguments are provided as a JSON array of strings.\nCMD [\u0026quot;echo\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Hello world\u0026quot;]  ENV: Define a default value for an environment variable, in case it isn’t provided when a container is created; this may be done in the Dockerfile file, using the ENV instruction.\nENV radius=20  The environment variables can be access in shell by $radius, in Node.JS by process.env.name\nVOLUME: store your data in a persistent file system.\nVOLUME /path/to/directory  The /path/to/directory is a path to a directory used inside the image. When a container is created using the docker run command, the -v switch can be used to map this directory to an actual volume on the host system.\n Caveat: It’s best not to think about containers as long-lived, even when they are. Don’t store information inside the containers. In other words, ensure your containers are stateless, not stateful. A stateless container never stores its state when it is run while stateful containers store some information about their state each time they are run. We’ll see later on how and where to store your container’s state. Docker containers are very stable, but the reason for having stateless containers is that this allows for easy scaling up and recovery. More about that later.\n EXPOSE: Purely for documentation purposes. It enables someone who wants to run a container from your image to know which ports they should redirect to the outside world using the -p switch of the docker run command.\nListen to TCP port 80:\nEXPOSE 80  Build command Build the dockerfile in current directory and name the image as \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;\ndocker build -t \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; .  Run a container from the image created (i.e. hello).\n--rm let docker trash the created container after execution.\ndocker run --rm hello  -it allows the user to stop the container using Ctrl-C from the command-line\ndocker run --rm -it -p 8082:80 webserver  3. Publish Docker Images A three-step process:\n  Build your image (docker build) with the appropriate prefix name or tag (docker tag) an existing one appropriately.\nFor a image in the current directory that is not built yet:\ndocker build -t \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;tag\u0026gt; .  For an existing image:\ndocker tag \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;tag\u0026gt;    Log into the Registry (docker login).\ndocker login -u \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; -p \u0026lt;password\u0026gt;    Push the image into the Registry (docker push).\ndocker push \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;tag\u0026gt;    Private registries: A private registry ensures that only you can access your private images, while a public registry allows you to make your private images public for selective parties.\nWhich list of factors influences the size of an image?\n  The files included in your image\n Avoid COPY instructions that are too broad like COPY . . Use .dockerignore to exclude files that should be excluded from the build    The base image size\n debian:8-slim is smaller than debian:8, nginx:1.15-alpine is smaller than nginx:1.15    Image layers\n  In a future build, Docker will use the cached part instead of recreating it as long as it is possible.\n  When pushing a new version of the image to a Registry, the common part is not pushed.\n  When pulling an image from a registry, the common part you already have is not pulled.\nThe following docekrfile places COPY instruction at the very end as this is then instruction that will change a lot. If putting COPY right after FROM, the RUN instruction will also need to be pushed or pulled in this case.\nFROM debian:8 RUN apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt-get upgrade \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt-get dist-upgrade -y RUN apt-get install -y php5 COPY . .

However, it would be hard to use Jensen directly without proper transformation. Recall that Jensen\u0026rsquo;s Ineuqality states: $$ f(EX) \\le Ef(X) ~~~~~~~~~ \\text{if $f(.)$ is convex} \\\n$$\n$$ f(EX) \\ge Ef(X) ~~~~~~~~~ \\text{if $f(.)$ is concave.} $$\nAttempt 1 We can try to apply Jensen partially to the LHS to see if it gives us a intermediate expression.\nWe know that $f(a)=a^n$ is convex on $[0,\\infty)$ if $n \\ge 1$. Using Jensen, we have $$ E(X^n) \\ge (EX)^n \\ [E(X^n)]^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\ge [(EX)^n]^{\\frac{1}{n}}=EX $$ This is not we want as Jensen finds a lower bound for the LHS and proving $EX \\le [E(X^{m})]^{\\frac{1}{m}}$ does not lead to our goal.\nAttempt 2 What about applying to the concave function ($a^{\\frac{1}{m}}$) ?\nWe know that $f(a)=a^{\\frac{1}{n}}$ is concave on $[0,\\infty)$ if $n \\ge 1$. Using Jensen, we have $$ [E(X^n)]^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\ge E(X)^{n\\frac{1}{n}}=EX $$ Same lower bound. Not helpful, either!\nAttempt 3 The failure in finding a good intermediate form motivates me to look back and exam the correctness of the proposition in a basic case.\nRecall that variance of a randome variable is always non-negative: $$ Var(X) = E(X-EX)^2\t=EX^2-2E(XEX)+(EX)^2 $$\n$$ = EX^2-(EX)^2\t\\ge 0. $$\nWe have: $$ (EX)^2 \\le EX^2 \\Leftrightarrow EX \\le (EX^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\Leftrightarrow (EX^1)^{\\frac{1}{1}} \\le (EX^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}, $$ which is true for non-negative random variable.\nIn this case, $n=1, ~ m = 2$. Can we try to reverse the general case into a well-formatted form like $(EX)^2 \\le EX^2$? $$ (EX^n)^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\le (EX^m)^{\\frac{1}{m}} \\\n\\Leftrightarrow (EX^n)^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\le EX^m \\\n\\Leftrightarrow (EX^n)^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\le EX^{n\\frac{m}{n}} $$ Boom! The reversed roadmap for transforming basic case into our goal worked! Here we have a random variable $Y=X^n$, convex function $g(a)=a^{\\frac{m}{n}}$ as $\\frac{m}{n} \\ge 1$. The final form can be treated as $g(EY) \\le E[g(Y)]$, which is true by Jensen\u0026rsquo;s Inequality! We can finally prove the proposition!\nProof Let $Y=X^n, g(a) = a^{\\frac{m}{n}}$.\nSince $$ g''(a) = \\frac{m}{n}.(\\frac{m}{n}-1).a^{\\frac{m}{n}-2} \\ge 0 ~~\\forall a \\in [0, \\infty), $$ $g(a)$ is convex on $[0,\\infty)$.\nBy Jensen\u0026rsquo;s Inequality: $$ (EX^n)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = (EY)^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\le E(Y^{\\frac{m}{n}}) = E([X^n]^{\\frac{m}{n}})=EX^m $$\n$$ \\Leftrightarrow [E(X^{n})]^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\le [E(X^{m})]^{\\frac{1}{m}}. ~~~~~~~~~~~\\square $$\nConclusion We solved the problem by tracing back to the basic case and used it as a guide for proving the general case.
